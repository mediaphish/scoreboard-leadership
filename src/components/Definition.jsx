          Scoreboard Leadership is a dominance pattern where metrics are weaponized to drive compliance,
          appearances outrank outcomes, and people become a means to public wins. The “score” replaces the standard,
          and optics replace ownership. Velocity spikes, trust collapses. The antidote isn’t anti-measurement—it’s
          servant standards: clear roles, honest rhythms, and leaders who carry the cost instead of passing it down.
