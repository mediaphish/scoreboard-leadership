          <strong>Scoreboard Leadership</strong> is a dominance pattern where metrics are weaponized to drive
          compliance, optics outrank outcomes, and people become a means to public wins. The score replaces the
          standard; theater replaces trust. You get velocity spikes, shallow accountability, and hidden churn.
          The antidote isn’t anti-measurement—it’s <em>servant-led standards</em>: clear roles, honest rhythms,
          and leaders who carry the cost instead of pushing it down. This diagnostic names the disease so you
          can install a healthier operating system—one that compounds performance without burning out the people
          who create it.
